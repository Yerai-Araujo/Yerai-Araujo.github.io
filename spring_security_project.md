# Spring security project

## Project overview
This project is about a restaurant where we can buy meals.  
The goal of this project is to learn how to secure an application using Spring Security.  
Spring Security help us write less code to achieve one of the most critical aspects of an application: security.  

## Project architecture
The application we are going to develop consists of simple functionalities, since the goal of this project is to develop  
a secure application with Spring Security, therefore, it is mainly focused on functionalities related to the Spring Security framework.  
The web application consists of a fast food restaurant with home delivery, you can select the products you want, and then make the payment of the order.  
For persistence we use Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API) which is a Spring Framework module that simplifies the interaction with relational databases.  
It provides an abstraction layer over JPA to reduce the amount of repetitive code needed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.  
It also uses MySql which is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is used to store, manage and retrieve data  
in a structured manner using SQL (Structured Query Language).  

The application code is divided into the following packages:  
- Config: Contains the application configuration and custom filters.  
- Controllers: Contains the endpoints and the application frontend logic.  
- Entities: Contains the classes of the tables created in the database.  
- Handlers: Contains the logic of the reaction to events, such as successful authentication to the application.  
- Repositories: Contains the logic to map the classes in the database.  
- Services: Contains the backend logic.

To implement the authentication process, a custom filter has been created to add the functionality to generate a JWT (JSON Web Token) and assign it  
to the users that successfully authenticate.  
For the authorization process, a second authorization filter has been added, which has also been customized to authorize users with JWT.  
In addition, another way to authenticate has been added, the authentication has been delegated with OAuth2. Users with a GitHub account can authenticate  
using their GitHub account credentials.  
On the other hand, the authentication is two-factor, this implies that when the user correctly enters his credentials, he must also read a QR code and  
enter the key generated by that QR.  
Finally, an unofficial SSL certificate has been generated, with the aim of implementing HTTPS so that communication data is transferred encrypted.  
HTTP requests will not be accepted on all application endpoints.  

Sequence diagram of placing an order  
The following image shows the sequence diagram that a user follows to place an order in the application. The user first has to authenticate with  
his credentials, once authenticated he will be redirected to the page that generates the QR code. On this page the user has to use Google Authenticator  
to read the QR code, when the QR code is read the user will receive a six digit otp code that must be entered. If the code is valid he will be redirected  
to the main page of the application, from this page he can go to the /design page to design a new order. The user chooses his order and is redirected  
to the payment page, here the user confirms and pays for the order. The process of placing an order ends with a redirection to the main page,  
so that new orders can be placed.
